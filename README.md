# LinearRegression_insurance
This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using Python to build a predictive model. It covers everything from data preprocessing to training, evaluation, and prediction using a real-world dataset.
This project focuses on implementing a Linear Regression model using Python to predict continuous outcomes based on input features. Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in supervised machine learning, and this notebook walks through its complete workflow in a beginner-friendly and practical manner.

The notebook begins with data loading and exploration, where we inspect the structure, types, and relationships within the dataset. It then covers data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and feature scaling where necessary.

Next, the project demonstrates how to build a Linear Regression model using the scikit-learn library. We train the model on the processed data and evaluate its performance using key metrics like RÂ² Score (to measure how well the model explains variance) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (to understand prediction error).

Finally, the model is used to make predictions, giving a clear view of how it performs on unseen data. This project is ideal for those starting out with machine learning and looking to understand how regression models work in real-world scenarios.
